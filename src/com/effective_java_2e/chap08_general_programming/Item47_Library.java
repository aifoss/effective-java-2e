 * Item 47: Know and use the libraries.
 *
 * By using a standard library, you take advantage of the knowledge of the experts who wrote it and the experience of those who used it before you.
 *
 * Numerous features are added to the libraries in every major release, and it pays to keep abreast of these additions.
 * Every programmer should be familiar with the content of java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.io.
